Image Encryption using Latin Squares
------------------------------------
In this project, a symmetric-key Latin square image cipher (LSIC) is used for grayscale and color images. We develop new Latin square image encryption primitives including Latin Square Whitening, Latin Square S-box and Latin Square P-box. Provide a new way of integrating probabilistic encryption in image encryption by embedding random noise in the least significant image bit-plane. Construct LSIC with these Latin square image encryption primitives all on one keyed Latin square in a new loom-like substitution-permutation network. Consequently, LSIC may achieve many desired properties of a secure cipher including a large key space, high key sensitivities, uniformly distributed cipher text, semantically secure, and robustness against channel noise.
